# Bioinformatics_Project
This project aims to learn and apply a knowledge-based potential for RNA 3D structures using distance-dependent statistical energy functions.  The goal is to use many known RNA structures (from PDB) to learn how often different base pairs (A, U, C, G) appear at specific C3’–C3’ distances, and then use these statistics to score a new RNA 3D model.
